# Major-Project-Final

## Introduction
This was my major project for year 12 which I named Digit Reboot and it is a progam that teaches the user how to touch type.

## Technologies
It was programmed in Python 3.9.4 utilising the pygame module for the GUI.

## How to run
Note: This will guide will focus entirely on installing it to a Windows 10 machine.

1. Ensure you have Python 3 installed on your computer.
2. Ensure you have downloaded the pygame module using your command prompt. The following command entered into the command prompt will download the module:
    - pip install pygame
3. Download the python files included in this program to one folder on your computer.
4. Run 'main.py' to use the program.

## Final Remarks
It could do with some improvements and this may not work indefinitely but I hope you enjoy using it.
