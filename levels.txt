now we have learnt the whole alphabet plus some punctuation characters such as; ,, ., and /. hopefully we will be able to develop our skills in these letters more.
welcome you have made it to level twenty nine. we will look at more features of typing later but for now have a go at typing these sentences.
remember try to not look at the keyboard, if you get lost and want to find your place on the keyboard again just remember the f and j keys have bumps on them.
if that still is not enough to reposition yourself on the keyboard, look at the display on the screen showing you what finger needs to press what the key you are at.
well i would say we are beginning to become more accustomed to the keyboard as the words per minute, or wpm, limit begins to get higher and higher.
the reason why we avoid looking at the keyboard when typing is to reduce the amount of thinking time that happens when you want to type a word like; zoo or xylophone.
since looking down at the keyboard and manually trying to find the keys can be quite time consuming, we will develop our muscle memory through repitition.
the repetition of pressing down keys without the need to look at a keyboard so that you can become a master typer.
it is quite the good idea, if i do say so myself, it is rather genius, just the thought of being able to produce accurate with your eyes closed is like perfection.
i hope that your fingers are beginning to get use to where the usual letters that we are using quite often but there are some letters that we may practice a bit more in the coming texts suchs as; q, p, z, x, c and v.
if you have ever took a trip to the zoo you might see some pretty zebras or some cheetahs. i know one thing you will not find in in there and that is a vase, it is too fragile for an animal to be having. if you had a musical animal you could give them a xylophone.
have a crack at some of these annoying hand movements; zqa /p; xws .ol ced ,ik vrf muj. and here is just random combination of letters; dfwoiajf lakfjpow zcnpqeij etoquer vnkaldhf wiuhf adhfiwhu. how did you enjoy that/ i know that i gave me less work to do.
woo hoo we are at level forty, maybe it is time to go back to learning more typing stuff. we will be beginning to look at capital letters. and something that you might not be comfortable with but will soon come to master is pressing the shift key with your right pinky.
